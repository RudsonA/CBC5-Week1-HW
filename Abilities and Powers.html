            <div class="LuffyInfo">
                <p class="p1">Luffy uses his legs (Just his hand post-timeskip) as pumps to increase the blood flow in his body. This provides him more oxygen and nutrients. Enhancing Speed and Strength though affecting his endurance to the point of paralysis after prolonged use. Rob Lucci compares its affect to doping. Luffy can use this technique because of his Rubber Blood vessels which don't tear under extreme stress.

                        Post Time-skip he gains much more control over this Gear, saving his Stamina. He can activate and deactivate it quickly. Used in combination with Haki he also can use much more powerful attacks.</p>

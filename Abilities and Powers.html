                    <p class="p1">Devil Fruits are mystical fruits found throughout the world that, when consumed, provide the eater a special ability, depending on the type and variation of the Fruit itself. With only one notable exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit.</p>

                <h3>Haki</h3>
                <p class="p1">Haki is a mysterious power that is found in every living being in the world. It is not that different from the typical senses. However, most people do not notice it or fail to awaken it. Broadly speaking, there are two types of Haki available to everyone, given the proper training; however, there is a third type that only a certain group of "chosen ones" are said to possess.</p>

            <div class="LuffyInfo">
                <p class="p1">The most common usage of this Haki allows the user to sense the presence of others even if they are concealed from view or too far to be seen naturally. The user can also use this Haki to predict an opponent's moves shortly before they make them, thereby making the attack much easier to evade with enough skill.

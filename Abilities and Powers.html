                <h3>Haki</h3>
                <p class="p1">Haki is a mysterious power that is found in every living being in the world. It is not that different from the typical senses. However, most people do not notice it or fail to awaken it. Broadly speaking, there are two types of Haki available to everyone, given the proper training; however, there is a third type that only a certain group of "chosen ones" are said to possess.</p>

                <p class="p1">Haoshoku Haki is a rare form of Haki that cannot be attained through training. Only one in several million people have this ability. This type of Haki allows the user to exert their willpower over others.

            </div>
            <div class="LuffyInfo">
                <p class="p1">The most common usage of this Haki allows the user to sense the presence of others even if they are concealed from view or too far to be seen naturally. The user can also use this Haki to predict an opponent's moves shortly before they make them, thereby making the attack much easier to evade with enough skill.
